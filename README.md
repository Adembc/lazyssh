Lazyssh is a terminal-based, interactive SSH manager inspired by tools like lazydocker and k9s — but built for managing your fleet of servers directly from your terminal.
<br/>
With lazyssh, you can quickly navigate, connect, manage, and transfer files between your local machine and any server defined in your ~/.ssh/config. No more remembering IP addresses or running long scp commands — just a clean, keyboard-driven UI.

## ✨ Features

### Server Management
- 📜 Read & display servers from your `~/.ssh/config` in a scrollable list.
- ➕ Add a new server from the UI by specifying alias, host/IP, username, port, identity file.
- ✏ Edit existing server entries directly from the UI.
- 🗑 Delete server entries safely.
- 📌 Pin / unpin servers to keep favorites at the top.
- 🏓 Ping server to check status.

### Quick Server Navigation
- 🔍 Fuzzy search by alias, IP, or tags.
- 🖥 One‑keypress SSH into the selected server (Enter).
- 🏷 Tag servers (e.g., prod, dev, test) for quick filtering.
- ↕️ Sort by alias or last SSH (toggle + reverse).


### Upcoming
- 📁 Copy files between local and servers with an easy picker UI.
- 📡 Port forwarding (local↔remote) from the UI.
- 🔑 Enhanced Key Management:
    - Use default local public key (~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub or ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub)
    - Paste custom public keys manually
    - Generate new keypairs and deploy them
    - Automatically append keys to ~/.ssh/authorized_keys with correct permissions
